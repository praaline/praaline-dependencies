                    A mode ID is an unique number which is associated with a mode in an application. This allows modes with the same name to be added if desired. From the developer's perspective you don't have to reimplement this function in your interface implementation. In that case the Qtilities::CoreGui::ModeManager class will assign an unique mode ID when the mode is added to the mode manager and a debug message will be printed with information about the newly assigned mode ID.

                    It is however desired to specify your own mode ID in some cases, more specifically if you use the Qtilities::CoreGui::DynamicSideWidgetViewer widget in your application and you want dynamic side viewer widgets to appear only in specific application modes. To achieve this
                    your modeID() must appear in the list of Qtilities::CoreGui::Interfaces::ISideViewerWidget::destinationModes() for a specific side viewer widget
                    implementation.

                    \note Mode IDs available for user modes range from 100 - 999. The mode manager starts to auto-assign unique mode IDs from 1000 onwards for modes which does not have their own IDs.

                  When your IMode implementation does not reimplement modeID(), it will automatically return the mode ID which was assigned by the ModeManager.
                  If you want to use your own mode ID you must reimplement modeID() and return your mode there, or set it using this function.
