        /*!
        The PointerList provides monitoring and accessing of object pointers which are attached to it. Other than
        QObjectCleanupHandler the PointerList class provides access functions to the objects attached to it and
        emits signals to indicate its activity.

        When creating a new PointerList object with the cleanup_when_done constructor parameter set to true, the PointerList
        will delete all objects attached to it when it is destructed.

        For example:
\code
QObject* test = new QObject;
QObject* test2 = new QObject;
PointerList* test_list = new PointerList(true);
test_list->addObject(test);
test_list->addObject(test2);

delete test;
delete test_list;
\endcode

        The above code will result in the following actions inside test_list
\code
test_list: Adding object test.
test_list: Adding object test2.
test_list: Removing object test from the pointer list when it is destructed.
test_list: Delete object test2 during destruction of test_list. Deleting it will also result in test2 being removed from the pointer list before it is destructed.
\endcode
