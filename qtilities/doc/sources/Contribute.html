The recommended way to contribute to the %Qtilities project is to fork the repository on <a href="http://github.com/JPNaude/Qtilities">Github</a>. This allows you to
modify and extend %Qtilities in your own forked repository.
<br><br>
If you however want to contribute to the master %Qtilities repository, it is required to complete a Contributor License Agreement. This counts for any
contributions including: code, documentation and ideas. Alternatively, you can feel free to Fork the repository and work on your own modifications there.
<br><br>
The purpose of this agreement is best to define the terms under which
intellectual property is contributed to %Qtilities. This allows me to
defend %Qtilities should there be a legal dispute regarding any parts of %Qtilities in the future.
<br><br>
Contribution agreements in the open source community are not uncommon and there are
many articles describing the reasoning behind it. If you are not familiar with contribution agreements,
feel free to read the following article which decsribes the purpose and scope of such agreements:
